# Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis

This is an analysis of Rockbuster's data in order to answer key questions about their customers so they can develop an effective strategy to launch their new onlinve service.

## Introduction

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. 
Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is 
planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Key Questions

The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data

I used Postgre SQL to analyze the Rockbuster relational database management system. 
The data set includes information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history and addresses.
